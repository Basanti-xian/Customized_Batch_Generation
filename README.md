# Customized_Batch_Generation


During training, every input batch is generated by randomly cropped images into subimages.

As for test, images would also be cropped. Then, all of the cropped patches would be participated into voting for final prediction of the whole image.

How to get the details patch? 
   The maximum and minimum width and height are ramdomly generate within a range.Then, the patch would be resized to 224x224.
	 This crop method can be improved, if we do a object detection first to find out the bags location. 
	 Then we can seperate the background with bags. Background didn't contain details, should not be cropped.
